# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to provide a historical overview for a collection of PyBer rideshare data for the four-month period between January, 2019 and May, 2019. The purpose of this analysis is to read through ride sharing data and determine key metrics that will allow to visualize and compare rural, suburban, and urban cities' rides. This included total rides, drivers, and fares, as well as average fares per ride and per driver. This data was organized to various tables.

Resources

Data Source(s): city_data.csv, ride_data.csv (Provided by Management)
Software: Jupyter notebook server 6.3.0, running Python 3.7.10 64-bit (Dependencies: matplotlib, numpy, os, pandas)

The above figure shows that there is a huge gap in the number of rides in urban cities and suburban or rural ones (2.6:1), as well as between urban and rural (13:1). Moreover, the number of drivers in urban areas is approximately five times that of suburban cities, and 31 times that of rural towns. Similarly, the number of rides per driver favors rural and suburban drivers over urban ones. 0.68 Rides/Driver in Urban Cities vs. 1.28 in Suburban and 1.6 in Rural is the relationship.

When we look at the income created, the Average Fare per Ride is 20% lower in urban cities than suburban, and 30% lower in urban cities versus rural.

Rural drivers clearly outperform Suburban and Urban drivers in terms of Average Fare per Driver. The ratio is 3.3:1 for rural vs. urban, and 2.4:1 for suburban vs. urban.

The above figure chart illustrates that the quantity of money made by the service is fairly steady over the time period studied (January to May). Urban cities generate the most total revenue, followed by suburban and rural locations. When comparing urban and suburban cities, the average connection is 2:1, while the same relationship between urban and rural cities is 9:1.

The observed outcome is not surprising, given that cities are expected to generate more revenue because they have more inhabitants than suburban or rural locations.

Conclusions:

    1. Most revenue in PyBer is generated by Urban Cities
    2. In Rural areas customers pay more fare as compared to Suburban  & Urban areas.
    3. Drivers earns less money per ride in Urban as compared to Rural


Summary:

The data may be used to consider the following:

1. Consider incentives to hire more suburban/rural drivers since the avg fare is so high. Whether this is to high demand or longer rides or some other factor should be investigated. If rides are more profitable then getting more rural/suburban business should be a top priority.

2. Consider increasing the fare in urban areas for more profit since almost 2/3 of rides are in urban areas.

3. Considering reducing price per ride in rural area might attract more customers for daily ride or could introduce ride sharing idea for more revenue by more rides daily.
